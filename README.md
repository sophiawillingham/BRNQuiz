## üß† Need Help?

If you have any issues , reach out to your instructor before test day.


if you want to change the text of the multiple chocie answers and the answers you should:

In QuestionFragment.java
//NEW: Example question and 6 options
private String question = "Which planet is known as the Red Planet?";
private String[] answers = {"Earth", "Venus", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Mercury"};

Just replace the string in question:
private String question = "What is the capital of France?";
