# BRN-Quiz Starter Code

Welcome to the **Starter Code for BRN-Quiz**!  
This repository contains the base code you’ll need to complete your upcoming test.

## Features
BRN-Quiz is a state-of-the-art Quiz App that:
- Selects and displays one multiple-choice question, 
- Lets the user select an answer from a ListView, and 
- Shows whether the selected answer is correct upon pressing a Submit Button. 
- It uses solid-state-quantum technology to keep track of how many times you have selected the correct answer.

## Make sure you:
1) Fork this repository 
2) Have a working local copy of your forked project ready to go **before test day**

## 🍴 Forking the Repository

1. Click the **“Fork”** button in the upper-right corner of this repository’s GitHub page.
